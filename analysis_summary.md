# Detailed Analysis Summary: Airline Crash Sentiment Distribution Drift

## üéØ Executive Summary

This analysis demonstrates how external crisis events cause severe and measurable distribution drift in sentiment analysis systems. Using a simulated airline crash scenario, we tracked sentiment changes across multiple airlines over time, revealing critical insights for ML system monitoring and crisis management.

## üìä Quantitative Results

### Distribution Shift Metrics

| Time Period | Negative % | Neutral % | Positive % | TV Distance | Drift Level |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pre-Crisis | 60.4% | 23.0% | 16.6% | 0.000 | Baseline |
| Hours 1-6 | 95.6% | 3.2% | 1.1% | 0.352 | EXTREME |
| Days 1-3 | 87.8% | 9.5% | 2.7% | 0.274 | HIGH |
| Week 1 | 74.7% | 17.5% | 7.8% | 0.143 | MODERATE |
| Month 1 | 71.2% | 20.8% | 8.0% | 0.109 | MODERATE |

### Statistical Significance

All distribution shifts showed **highly significant** differences from baseline:
- **Hours 1-6**: p < 2.10e-34 (KS test)
- **Days 1-3**: p < 1.83e-22 (KS test)
- **Week 1**: p < 2.65e-05 (KS test)
- **Month 1**: p < 9.91e-03 (KS test)

## üîç Key Findings

### 1. Immediate Crisis Impact
- **Magnitude**: Negative sentiment jumps 35.2 percentage points within hours
- **Speed**: Distribution shift detectable within minutes of crisis news
- **Universality**: Affects ALL airlines, not just the incident airline

### 2. Spillover Effects Analysis
- **Industry-Wide Impact**: Competitor airlines see 87-96% negative sentiment
- **Recovery Differential**: Affected airline recovers faster than competitors
- **Long-term Persistence**: Month 1 shows affected airline at 68.6% vs competitors at 77.2%

### 3. Recovery Patterns
- **Phase 1 (Hours)**: Uniform extreme negativity across all airlines
- **Phase 2 (Days)**: Slight differentiation begins to emerge
- **Phase 3 (Weeks)**: Clear separation between affected and other airlines
- **Phase 4 (Month)**: Paradoxical reversal - competitors show higher negativity

## üßÆ Technical Methodology

### Topic Modeling Results
- **BERTopic Analysis**: Discovered 53 distinct topics from 14,640 tweets
- **Outlier Rate**: 46.7% of tweets classified as outliers (topic -1)
- **Top Topics**: Flight cancellations, baggage issues, customer service

### Synthetic Data Generation
- **Volume**: 3,300 synthetic tweets across 5 time periods
- **Realism**: Context-appropriate vocabulary and sentiment patterns
- **Validation**: Statistical distributions match expected crisis patterns

### Drift Detection Methods
- **Total Variation Distance**: Primary metric for distribution comparison
- **Wasserstein Distance**: Earth mover's distance for distribution shifts
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Statistical significance testing
- **Threshold Classification**: 4-tier severity system (LOW ‚Üí EXTREME)

## üìà Business Implications

### For Airlines
1. **Crisis Preparedness**: Need rapid response systems for reputation management
2. **Monitoring Systems**: Industry-wide sentiment tracking, not just own brand
3. **Recovery Strategy**: Different approaches needed for affected vs. competitor airlines
4. **Long-term Impact**: Budget for extended negative sentiment periods

### For ML Systems
1. **Model Retraining**: Immediate retraining triggers needed for extreme drift
2. **Alert Thresholds**: TV Distance > 0.3 requires immediate attention
3. **Spillover Monitoring**: Track related entities, not just primary subjects
4. **Recovery Modeling**: Plan for months-long distribution shifts

### For Social Media Platforms
1. **Information Verification**: Rapid fact-checking during crisis events
2. **Sentiment Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of industry-wide patterns
3. **Algorithm Adjustment**: Temporary weighting changes during crises
